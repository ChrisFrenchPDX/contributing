# Esri Community Code of Conduct

v1.0.0, February 2019

## Purpose

At Esri, we believe geography can make the world a better place. In adopting this Community Code of Conduct, we as Esri employees are committed to fostering a welcoming environment for collaboration, creativity, and the free exchange of ideas for developing, maintaining, and using open source GIS software. We aim to empower all participants to actively engage and help build a friendly and safe Esri open source developer community.

Whether publicly or privately, and whether in-person or online, we expect all members of this community to interact both professionally and without harassment toward others, regardless of race, color, creed, gender, gender identity, religion, marital status, domestic partner status, genetic information, age, national origin or ancestry, military or veteran status, sexual orientation, or either physical or mental disability.

See [Contributing to Esri Open Source Projects](https://github.com/Esri/contributing/blob/master/README.md) for more details on copyright, licensing, and using GitHub.
